        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>You're at dinner with the homies. It's time to pay and the server brings just one bill. Who cares about calculating how much each person actually has to pay? Why not make it random? Someone could pay 13% of the bill, someone could pay 30% of the bill. Let the fun begin!</p>

        <h3>Why tho?</h3>
        <p>I've had this idea in my head for a long time. Like years. I always thought it would be fun for when I go out to dinner with my friends. I like gambling so I thought, "Why not gamble with the bill?" And I needed a personal project to work on.</p>

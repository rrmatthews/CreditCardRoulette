        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>You're at dinner with the homies. It's time to pay and the server brings just one bill. Who cares about calculating how much each person actually has to pay? Why not make it random? Someone could pay 13% of the bill, someone could pay 30% of the bill. Let the fun begin!</p>
